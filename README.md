### Hi there 👋 I am Austin

I love finding solutions to problems. 
Often it looks like this `00110100 00110010`

The last few years, I have been working at Hummingbird Technologies to develop the architecture and algorithms for processing drone and satellite 🛰️ imagery at scale. I recently moved to [Dojo](https://dojo.tech/) where I am leading one of their data engineering teams.

I have been learning [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) for fun recently and what better way to learn something than to build something with it.
So, I made a [peg solitaire](https://github.com/austincv/peg-solitaire) game. If you fancy a game click [here](https://www.austincv.com/peg-solitaire)
